# SONAR_DETECTOR
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying sonar data into two categories: rocks and minerals. The project includes data preprocessing, modelling, and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms.
I can provide some information on using machine learning for sonar detection. Sonar (Sound Navigation And Ranging) systems are commonly used for underwater detection and measurement purposes. Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, have been increasingly applied to analyze sonar data and improve the detection performance.
